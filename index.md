# [kAIron](https://github.com/udit-pandey/kairon).
Kairon is a set of tools built on the RASA framework with a helpful UI interface. It is envisioned as a web based microservices driven suite that helps train Rasa contextual AI assistants at scale. It is designed to make the lives of those who work with ai-assistants easy, by giving them a no-coding web interface to adapt , train , test and maintain such assistants .
